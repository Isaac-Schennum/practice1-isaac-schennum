tips to working with git and github

Isaac Schennum

I just tell people that I major in Data Science and I switched from Software Engineering last year.

I've mostly been doing my classwork and trying to find a summer intership (can't think of a 3rd thing).

I feel so disorganized, I don't know if I have a single thing that counts as a "tool" or "strategy" to keep myself organized.
Usually it's not a big problem, but I find it a little funny.
